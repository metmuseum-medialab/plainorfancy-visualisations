# Plain or Fancy

  The Metropolitan Museum of Art had a special exhibition from April 2013 to September 2013 called "Plain or Fancy". We asked visitors in the gallery and online what they thought of the most 'ambiguous' objects. This repository is some experimental attempts at creating visualisations around the data. There are two other related repositories - [the raw data](http://github.com/metmuseum-medialab/plainorfancy-data), and [the interactive](http://github.com/metmuseum-medialab/plainorfancy).

  The current version is pushed to the [gh-pages branch](http://github.com/metmuseum-medialab/plainorfancy-visualisations#gh-pages), and is [viewable online](http://metmuseum-medialab.github.io/plainorfancy-visualisations).
